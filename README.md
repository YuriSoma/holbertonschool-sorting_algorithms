This is a repository for the Holberton School team project "C - Sorting algorithms & Big O".

Learning Objectives:
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

Below is a list of all tasks of the project:
Bubble sort - "Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm".
Insertion sort - "Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm".
Selection sort - "Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm".

Note: all tasks have been solved by prepration and collaboration of:
Repository owner: Yaser Al-Elayn - https://github.com/YuriSoma/
Collaborator: Mohammed Al-Ahmry - https://github.com/MDDO0/
